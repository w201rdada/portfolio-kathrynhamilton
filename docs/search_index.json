Abstract of my first cool idea In the first cool idea, we look at compiling scientific study results into an easily accessible and structured database for public consumption. Abstract of my second cool idea In the second cool idea, we look at harnessing the powers of social media and cellular networks to save lives during tropical storms or tornadoes. About the author Hi, my name is Kathryn and I’m a MIDS student at UC Berkeley. Figure 1: This is me! I grew up an avid downhill skiier, lover of basketball and volleyball, and aspiring mathematician in Calgary, Canada. Following the career path of both my parents, I went on to become an engineer: in June 2016 I graduated from Queen’s University with a Bachelors Degree in Mathematics and Engineering. Shortly after that, I moved to Michigan to join Ford Motor Company’s autonomous vehicle group, where I currently work on reliability models, functional safety and other systems engineering projects. In September 2017, I started MIDS and am looking forward to the next couple years of learning all about data! Updated: 2017-11-19 "],
["Infographic-Database.html", "Spreading Knowledge, One Infographic at a Time The Problem: The Underused Value of Research The Solution: Research and Media Collide Considerations: Separating Fact and Fallacy", " Spreading Knowledge, One Infographic at a Time Keywords infographic, database, integrity, social media, knowledge, facts The Problem: The Underused Value of Research Have you ever scrolled through your news feed to find an infographic displaying a few simple statistics that blow your mind? Social and political issues are often highlighted in this manner, for example a short video clip outlining information about women in the work place or average wage by ethnicity. These tidbits of tangible information shared in a simple and clean way are incredibly informative and eye-opening. If you could, wouldn’t you want to have access to a tool that produces custom visualizations with valuable information on almost any topic you can imagine? Governments across the world collect and publish large amounts of data every year, typically obtained through censuses or other pointed studies. This data is readily available online, but often comes in the form of hefty files or long-winded reports. Other bodies, such as business or non-profit organizations, also collect and publish valuable information that could positively impact education or decision making. Unfortunately, the insights from these datasets often don’t make it past page three of a tab buried deep within an unassuming website. Figure 2: An infographic describing infographic best practices. The Solution: Research and Media Collide I would like to take advantage of these datasets to produce an educational visualization database and search tool. The product will routinely read and process data posted by verifiable research bodies. Each data set will be tagged by topic using natural language processing, and then aggregated with data processed from other sources that covers the same subject. A variety of visualization styles or templates, including different types of charts, graphs, and phrases combined to form short video clips, pictures, or reports, will be constructed. Figure 3: A satirical infographic outlining a variety infographic types. When users enter a search term into the tool, the system queries its database and returns results based on relevancy, credibility and popularity. The data sets returned by the query are matched to a visualization template using a set of best-practice rules and machine learning algorithms, and finally displayed to the user. From there, the user can interact with the search results in a number of ways, such as: scrolling through search results, viewing raw data sets, viewing information about the source of data, customizing visualization templates, and finally saving an infographic visualization to their desktop or posting to social media. The tool would accumulate data covering a broad range of topics both serious and trivial, making it useful for boardrooms, classrooms, and living rooms alike. In addition to interacting with the tool as a public user, stakeholders such as governments, businesses, and nonprofits may submit datasets for consideration to be added to the database, or liscence the tool to directly process and visualize data internal to their organizations. Considerations: Separating Fact and Fallacy There are a major considerations that will need to be solved. As effective an instructive tool as infographics may be, they are notorious for showing half-truths, using data to skew ideas, or citing unreliable sources. Each of these problems will need to be assessed and protected against to ensure the truth of the data is conveyed most accurately. This means verifying the source and scope of raw data, ensuring visualization algorithms uphold a standard of quality, as well as recognizing the stigmas and limitations attached to infographics as a visualization medium. In addition, users will need to be protected from polling data incorrectly or selecting inappropriate visualization templates when generating infographics. Algorithms to pull and process data must be safeguarded against accidental misuse or error. There is considerable work to be done to ensure the product is both effective and truthful. Figure 4: Social media giant Facebook struggles with fake news. That being said, the product shows great potential at this preliminary stage. The tool will have the ability to be easily integrated with both formal reports and social media newsfeeds, or used directly in educational institutions and workplaces alike. In addition to its entertainment value, the product provides an educational solution for people of any walk of life to visualize the reality of important topics such as politics or economics, which in turn allows truthful knowledge to disseminate through the greater public. This knowledge, as a result, has the potential to positively impact personal and public decision making. The product will no doubt be a valuable tool that brings two existing worlds, media and research, together for the greater good. "],

The Aftermath.", " Mega Storms: Real-Time Optimization of Resource Allocation in Large Storms Keywords storms, resource allocation, first responders, displacement, government, social media, optimization, real-time The Storm Front. Nature is at times anything but gentle and although we too have the power to raise and level cities, people are frequently left helpless during and after massive storms such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes. While emergency response systems have improved dramatically in the past century, people still endure great risk during storm events regardless of preparation or foresight. The advancements in connectivity over the past couple decades, however, may stand to develop storm response systems by optimizing the allocation of emergency responders and supplies, which can ultimately save lives. The Eye of the Storm. To what extent can connectivity improve storm safety and relief efforts? We will only know for certain when these types of systems are used first-hand to combat the effects of a natural disaster, but upon first glance I believe the impact could be staggering. The proposed solution uses an aggregation of real-time social media and mobile device data to track the location and status of people during a storm in combination with meteorological data forecasting a storm’s movement, characteristics and strength. The system is best implemented as a government-funded tool that, in conjunction with social media services and cellular data providers, collects user data during inclement weather. In addition to gathering data, the tool pushes notifications to citizens’ cellular devices, through an embedded operating system functionality, for example, which allows people to check in with authorities as safe or request emergency assistance. This information, combined with real-time population density and movement data from social media posts or cellular device locations, and storm path data from meterological prediction algorithms, will be aggregated and provided to decision makers. These insights will provide sufficient information to effectively allocate available resources, including rescue workers, medical supplies, food, water and shelter, on a real-time basis. The result is an emergency response system that can have an impactful presense during both the onset and peak of a storm, in addition to the days, weeks, or months of repairs that take place afterwards. The Aftermath. There are several roadblocks that immediately restrict this solution. Firstly, information privacy will be a concern of impacted citizens, as the system may need to collect data without informed consent. In this respect, there is a tradeoff between storing personal information regarding the location of individuals, which may be helpful in reuniting families after a storm, versus cleaning personal information from collected data to protect the privacy rights of individuals. While more descriptive data stands to improve the system’s accuracy and efficiency, even the barest data set, devoid of any personal information, may still have a significant impact on the ability for municipalities to dispatch rescue workers and other resources. In addition, there is potential for individual location and status information to be collected without breaching personal privacy, for example by using natural language process algorithms to interpret public social media posts relevant to the storm. A second barrier to entry is the cost and participation required to implement the solution. The system requires cooperation between many large stakeholders: politicians, emergency responders, cellular network providers, relevant social media companies, and meterorologists, for example, in addition to requiring a fair amount of physical infrastructure in order to operate. In this respect, there is a minimum about of buy-in required from these stakeholders in order for the system to be successful: in other words, the idea needs to be pursued actively by multiple parties or the implementation will not work. The opportunity to improve on response systems, however, is immense and worthwhile for all parties to seriously consider. Stakeholders may also find the system easier to justify or gain support for by implementing it incrementally, for example focusing first on a hazard reporting system before moving to emergency supply logisitics and subsequently an emergency responder optimization system. Finally, the physical infrastructure of the system will need to be robust to power outages, cell tower damage and other utility interruptions that may occur during a storm. If implemented correctly, the tool has the power to reduce the havoc a storm may reap on an area and assist communities in developing best practices and foresight to protect against future storms. In its full implementation, the system can help a city by minimizing lives lost, getting the right supplies into the hands that need them at the right time, and allowing citizens, governments and corporations to stand together in a united front.
