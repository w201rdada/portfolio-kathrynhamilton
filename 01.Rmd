## The Problem

Have you ever scrolled through your news feed to find an infographic displaying a few simple statistics that blow your mind? Social and political issues are often highlighted in this manner, for example a short video clip outlining information about women in the work place or average wage by ethnicity. These tidbits of tangible information shared in a simple and clean way are incredibly informative and eye-opening. If you could, wouldn't you want to have access to a tool that can produce custom visualizations with valuable information on almost any topic you can imagine?

Governments across the world collect and publish large amounts of data every year, typically obtained through censuses or other pointed studies. This data is readily available online, but often comes in the form of hefty files or long-winded reports. Other bodies, such as business or non-profit organizations, also collect and publish valuable information. The insights from these datasets, however, often don't make it past page three of a tab buried deep within an unassuming webpage.

## The Solution

I would like to take advantage of these datasets to produce an educational visualization database and search tool. The product would routinely read and process data posted by verifiable research bodies. Each data set would be tagged by topic, using natural language processing, and then aggregated to previously processed data covering the same topic. A variety of visualization styles or templates, including different types of charts, graphs, and sentences combined to form short video clips, pictures, or reports, will be constructed.

When users enter a search term into the tool, system queries its database and returns results based on relevancy, completeness and popularity. The data sets returned by the query are matched to a visualization template using a set of best-practice rules and machine learning algorithms, and finally displayed to the user. From there, the user can interact with the search results in a number of ways, including: scrolling through search results, viewing raw data sets, viewing the data source, customizing visualization templates, and finally saving a infographic visualization to their desktop, or posting to social media.

The tool would accumulate data covering a broad range of topics both serious and trivial, making it useful for boardrooms, classrooms, and living rooms alike. In addition to interacting with the tool as a public user, stakeholders such as governments, businesses, and nonprofits may submit datasets for consideration to be added to the database, or lisence the tool to directly process and visualize data internal to their organizations.

## Consideration

There are a major considerations that will need to be solved. As effective an instructive tool as infographics may be, they are notorious for showing half truths, using data to skew ideas, or citing noncredible sources. Each of these problems will need to be assessed and protected against to ensure the truth of the data is conveyed most accurately. This means verifying the source and scope of raw data, as well as recognizing the stigmas and limitations attached to infographics as a visualization medium. In addition, users can be mislead by polling data incorrectly or selecting an inappropriate visualization template when generating infographics. Algorithms to pull and process data must be safeguarded against accidental misuse or error. There is considerable worth to be done to ensure the product is both effective and truthful.

That being said, the product shows great potential at this preliminary stage. The tool can be easily integrated with both formal reports and social media newsfeeds, or used directly as a tool in educational institutions and workplaces alike.  In addition to its entertainment value, the product provides an educational solution for people of any walk of life to visualize the reality of important topics such as politics or economics, allowing truthful knowledge to disseminate through the greater public. This knowledge, as a result, will positively impact personal and public decision making.

The product will no doubt be a valuable tool that brings two existing worlds, media and research, together for the greater good.
