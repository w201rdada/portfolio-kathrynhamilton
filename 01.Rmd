## A beginning.

Have you ever scrolled through your news feed to find an infographic displaying a few simple statistics that blow your mind? Social and political issues are often highlighted in this manner, for example a short video clip outlining information about women in the work place or average wage by ethnicity. These tidbits of tangible information shared in a simple and clean way are incredibly informative and eye-opening. If you could, wouldn't you want to have access to a tool that can produce custom visualizations with valuable information on almost any topic you can imagine?

## A middle.

Governments across the world collect and publish large amounts of data every year, typically obtained through censuses or other pointed studies. This data is readily available online, but often comes in the form of hefty files or long-winded reports. Other bodies, such as business or non-profit organizations, also collect and publish valuable information. The insights from these datasets, however, often don't make it past page three of a tab buried deep within an unassuming webpage.

I would like to take advantage of these datasets to produce an educational visualization database and search tool. The product would routinely read and process data posted by verifiable research bodies. Each data set would be tagged by topic, using natural language processing, and then assigned a visualization style or template using a set of best-practice rules and machine learning algorithms. The results will be placed in an online database that can be searched by users. Ideally, the tool would also allow users to customize the content of their own infographics while ensuring statistical integrity.

## An end.

This tool provides an educational solution for people of any walk of life to visualize the reality of political, social, economic or environmental topics. Results of the product can be easily integrated with both formal reports and social media newsfeeds, or used directly as a tool in educational institutions and workplaces alike.

There are a major considerations that will need to be solved. As effective an instructive tool as infographics may be, they are notorious for showing half truths, using data to skew ideas, or citing noncredible sources. Each of these problems will need to be assessed and protected against to ensure the truth of the data is conveyed most accurately. In addition, readers can equally be mislead by poor selection of a visualization template. The algorithms to pull and process data must be safeguarded against accidental misuse or error.

While there is potential to capitalize on the product, it may just as simply be constucted for non-profit use as well. Regardless, the overall product will be a valuable tool that brings two already existing worlds, media and research, together for the greater good.
