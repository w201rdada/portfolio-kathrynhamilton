## The Storm Front.

Nature is at times anything but gentle and although we too have the power to raise and level cities, people are frequently left helpless during and after massive storms such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes. While emergency response systems have improved dramatically in the past century, people still endure great risk during storm events regardless of preparation or foresight. The advancements in connectivity over the past couple decades, however, may stand to develop storm response systems by optimizing the allocation of emergency responders and supplies, which can ultimately save lives.

## The Eye of the Storm.

The proposed solution uses an aggregation of real-time social media and cellular device data to track the location of people during a storm, in combination with meteorological data forecasting a storm's movement, characteristics and strength. The system is best implemented as a government-funded tool that, in conjunction with social media services and cellular data providers, collects user data during inclement weather. In addition to gathering data, the tool pushes notifications to citizens' cellular devices, if possible, allowing them to check in with authorities as safe or request emergency assistance. This information, combined with population density data, movement patterns of people in the affected area, and storm path predictions, can be sent to decision makers in order to effectively allocate emergency response resources including rescue workers, medical supplies, food, water and shelter. The system can have an impactful presense during both the onset and peak of a storm, in addition to the days, weeks, or months of repairs that take place in the aftermath.

## The Aftermath.

There are several roadblocks that immediately restrict this solution. Firstly, information privacy will be a concern of impacted citizens, as the system may need to collect data without informed consent. In this respect, there is a tradeoff between storing personal information regarding the location of individuals, which may be helpful in reuniting families after a storm, versus cleaning personal information from collected data to protect the privacy rights of individuals. Secondly, this solution faces a large economic barrier to entry. The system requires cooperation between many large stakeholders: politicians, emergency responders, network providers, and meterorologists, for example, in addition to requiring a fair amount of infrastructure in order to operate. The tool needs to be pursued completely in order to be a success. If implemented correctly, however, the tool has the power to reduce the havoc a storm may reap on an area by reducing lives lost, getting the right supplies into the hands that need them, and allowing citizens to stand together in a united front.
