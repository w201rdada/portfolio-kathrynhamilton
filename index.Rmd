# Welcome! {-}

Hello! This is a collection of my first two cool ideas for W201 Fall 2017. You can hear more about my candidate idea in the following video.

```{r video,echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Here is an explanation of my ideas!',fig.align='center',out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_url("https://drive.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/file/d/1Qxd-TfLKDmBPeW0xsM-JfzgaQKPJJQMp/view?usp=sharing")
```

  
Here is a high level summary of both of my cool ideas, in case videos aren't for you.
  
### Abstract: Mega Storms Idea {-}

In this cool idea, I look at harnessing the powers of social media and cellular networks to save lives during tropical storms or tornadoes.

### Abstract: Infographic Database Idea {-}

In this cool idea, I look at compiling scientific study results into an easily accessible and structured database for public consumption.

## About the author {-}

Hi, my name is Kathryn and I'm a MIDS student at UC Berkeley. 

```{r portrait,echo=FALSE,fig.cap='This is me!',fig.align='center',out.width='35%'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/kathryn_portrait.jpg')
```

I grew up an avid downhill skiier, lover of basketball and volleyball, and aspiring mathematician in Calgary, Canada. Following the career path of both my parents, I went on to become an engineer: in June 2016 I graduated from Queen's University with a Bachelors Degree in Mathematics and Engineering.

Shortly after that, I moved to Michigan to join Ford Motor Company's autonomous vehicle group, where I currently work on reliability models, functional safety and other systems engineering projects.

In September 2017, I started MIDS and am looking forward to the next couple years of learning all about data!
